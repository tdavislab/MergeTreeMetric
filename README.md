# MergeTreeMetric

This is a Python implementation of computing pairwise distance matrices for time-varying data. These matrices are calculated using four metrics, including bottleneck distance, Wasserstein distance, and labelled interleaving distance between two merge trees, as well as Euclidean distances between scalar fields.

The implementation is described in "Geometry Aware Merge Tree Comparisons forTime-Varying Data with Interleaving Distances" (under review).
